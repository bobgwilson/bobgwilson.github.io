## Bob Wilson, Software Engineer
Hi, I'm a Computer Science major at Michigan State University. After a long career as an Animator, I'm changing careers by studying Computer Science to become a Software Engineer. I live in Ann Arbor, MI.

## Michigan State University
I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a Math Cognate. My expected graduation date is December 2026. I'm having a great time learning C++ in CSE232 and Discrete Math in CSE260. I'm super excited about all the programming classes I'll be taking at MSU.

For my senior electives, I plan to take CSE435 Software Engineering and CSE472 Computer Graphics because I love creating software and computer graphics. I will take CSE434 Autonomous Vehicles as I love robotics and cars. I also plan to study Machine Learning in CSE404 and Artificial Intelligence in CSE404.


## Skydio Robotics Software Engineering Internship

I recently completed an Open Avenues internship with [Skydio](https://www.skydio.com/), the largest drone manufacturer in the US, and the world leader in autonomous drones:

* Developed a working dynamics simulation and feedback controller of a Skydio quadrotor drone
* Wrote quality Python code in a team environment using VS Code and packages NumPy, SciPy, and SymForce
* Delivered a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bobgwilson/skydio-quadrotor/blob/main/5-Controller-Full.ipynb) with Jupyter notebooks that include implementations and derivations
* Had a blast and learned a lot about writing code in a team environment at a major tech company.


## Washtenaw Community College
In Winter 2024, I studied Computer Science at Washtenaw Community College. I learned a little bit of Python, C++, HTML, and SQL in the CPS120 Intro to Computer Science class. I wrote all of the [Python code](https://github.com/bobgwilson/prime-numbers/blob/main/prime_numbers.py) on a team software project that generates prime and composite numbers and factorizes the composites, which won the Project Codeway class competition.

I learned a lot more about Python in the CPS141 Intro to Python class, and my final project was a Data Science Visualization project for crime statistics analysis. After the class, I became a [PCEP Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer](https://verify.openedg.org/?id=WLFT.A1TC.sJXu) (Python Institute PCEP-30-02)

I had a 4.0 GPA and was on the Dean's List - High Honors.


## Previous Career in Animation

Please see my separate [animation website](http://www.bobwilsonanimation.com/) for more info on my previous career as an Animator working at some of the world's top studios in Feature Animation, Visual Effects, and Video Games.
