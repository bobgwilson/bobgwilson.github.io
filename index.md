## Bob Wilson, Computer Science Student
Hi, I'm a Computer Science Student at Michigan State University seeking a Software Engineering Internship or Co-op in Southeast Michigan or remote.

## Michigan State University
I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a Math Cognate. My expected graduation date is May 2027. In Summer 2024 I got a perfect 4.0 GPA in all classes at MSU: Discrete Structures in Computer Science (CSE 260), Calculus 1 (MTH 132) and the C++ class Introduction to Programming 2 (CSE 232), where <a href="https://msugrades.com/courses/CSE_232/semesters#summer-2024" target="_blank">I was one of only 7 students out of 96 to get an A</a>.

In Fall 2024, I'm currently taking Introduction to Engineering Design (EGR 100), Calculus 2 (MTH 133), and the more advanced C++ class Object-Oriented Software Design (CSE 335).

I'm excited about the programming classes I'll be taking in the future at MSU. For my senior electives, I plan to take Software Engineering (CSE 435) and Computer Graphics (CSE 472), Autonomous Vehicles (CSE 434), Machine Learning (CSE 404), and Artificial Intelligence (CSE 404).

## Skydio Robotics Software Engineering Internship

I recently completed an Open Avenues internship with <a href="https://www.skydio.com/" target="_blank">Skydio</a>, the largest drone manufacturer in the US, and the world leader in autonomous drones:

* Developed a working dynamics simulation and feedback controller of a Skydio quadrotor drone
* Wrote quality Python code in a team environment using VS Code and packages NumPy, SciPy, and SymForce
* Delivered a <a href="https://github.com/bobgwilson/skydio-quadrotor/" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> with Jupyter notebooks that include implementations and derivations
* Had a blast and learned a lot about writing code in a team environment at a major tech company.


## Washtenaw Community College
In Winter 2024, I studied Computer Science at Washtenaw Community College. I learned a little bit of Python, C++, HTML, and SQL in the CPS120 Intro to Computer Science class. I wrote all of the <a href="https://github.com/bobgwilson/prime-numbers/blob/main/prime_numbers.py" target="_blank">Python code</a> on a team software project that generates prime and composite numbers and factorizes the composites, which won the Project Codeway class competition.

I learned a lot more about Python in the CPS141 Intro to Python class, and my final project was a Data Science Visualization project for crime statistics analysis. After the class, I became a <a href="https://verify.openedg.org/?id=WLFT.A1TC.sJXu" target="_blank">PCEP Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer</a> (Python Institute PCEP-30-02)


I achieved a perfect 4.0 GPA and was on the Dean's List - High Honors.


## Previous Career in Animation

Previously, I worked in the Entertainment industry on a number of blockbuster films, TV shows, and video games at some of the world’s top studios in Feature Animation (Pixar, DreamWorks), Visual Effects (Industrial Light & Magic, Digital Domain, MPC, Tippett), and Games (PlayStation, Electronic Arts).

While working at Skidmore Studio, I worked in the Advertising industry on TV commercials for major brands with ad agencies Doner, Campbell-Ewald, J. Walter Thompson, and Young & Rubicam. I also worked on a variety of automotive visualization projects for General Motors.
